I played around with both gnu-prolog and SWIprolog. I started using SWIprolog because it had a better library. I can't actually remember how I installed it, but I found this homebrew formula which should work.
```
brew install swi-prolog
```

To run code:
```
$ swipl
swiprol> [main].
swiprol> main().
```
