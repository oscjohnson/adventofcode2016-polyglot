# Advent of Code 2016 Polyglot

This is my submisson of the adventofcode 2016 challenges!

As this was a way for me to discover some (for me) new langugages the focus was not to optimize the algorithms. Some of the solutions are therefore painfully slow, I believe slowest algorithm takes about 40 minutes. That said, there are however some optimizations made to make it possible to retrieve the solutions within a human life time.

I have tried to add instructions to each day to simplify installing and running the code if someone would like to try the code out. As I am developing on a mac most tips are simply "brew install <language-stuff>". Also, I have only added instructions for mac so if you are on linux or windows you are out of luck!

Besides implementing the languages in this repo some other languages were also under consideration:
* Scheme
* Pony
* F#
* Julia
* R
* Racket
* Basic
* Fortran
* Vimscript

I recommend this way of discovering new languages, the challenges are big enough for you to get into and get a feel for the language (probably not become fluent but) without investing to much time and effort into the language. However I have invested more time than I'd like to admit into this, but that might just be me being slow. It did however prevent me from being in sync with completing the challenges daily. And much of my implementations was long after December was over. 

However depending on which languages you choose I believe it's possible to be in sync with the challenges as judging by [ttencate's solutions](https://github.com/ttencate/aoc2016) who also did a polyglot challenge and submitted the last code commit on December 25th.

Some caveats:
* day19 part2 is solved in js
* day22 part2 has no actual implementation, it is solved by printing the board and then paper and pen.
* day24 part1 part2 Implementation missing (crystal)
* day25 part1 part2 Implementation missing (c)
