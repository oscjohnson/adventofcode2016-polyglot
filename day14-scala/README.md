Install

You can use scala with either CLI or IDE, I used the command line and pretty much followed [this guide](http://docs.scala-lang.org/getting-started-sbt-track/getting-started-with-scala-and-sbt-on-the-command-line.html) to get up and running.

Part 2 takes about 15 minutes to run, which could definitely be improved on.
