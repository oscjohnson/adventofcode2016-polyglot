To install j I followed the instructions [here](http://code.jsoftware.com/wiki/System/Installation/All-in-One)


Then open up a jconsole from the same directory as the code file and run:
```
jconsole> 0!:1 < 'main.j'
jconsole> run input
```
If you are using the GUI editor load the file through the menu first.
Change "part"-variable in the code to "part1" or "part2" to recieve the solution for respective part.
